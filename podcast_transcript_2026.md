 It is February 19, 2026. And if you've been looking at your portfolio lately, or frankly, just looking out the window and feeling like the operating system of the global economy just got this massive, unannounced update over the last 12 months, you are absolutely not imagining things. You really aren't. We are seeing a convergence of forces right now that we haven't seen in decades. It's this hyper acceleration and technology on one side and then this grinding really heavy return to old school protectionism on the other. It's a massive friction point. Right. And we have a monster of a report to get through today. It's this comprehensive analysis of global financial and consumer markets at the turn of 2025 into 2026. But I want to be clear about our mission for this deep dive. Yeah, we're not just reading off stock tickers here. Exactly. We are trying to figure out how a specific set of massive macroeconomic forces, so AI chips, trade wars are directly influencing what everyday people are, you know, spraying on their necks in the morning, which I know sounds like a huge stretch, but it really isn't. The thesis of this deep dive is that the macro, those trillion dollar moves and the micro, the body missed you by its sephora, are actually the exact same story. It's a story about coping with speed. And let's, let's start with that speed or rather the engine of it, the titans of 2025, specifically the one that essentially ate the market. In video, the absolute behemoth, the numbers in this report are bordering on satirical at this point. As of October 2025, in video across the $5 trillion market cap barrier, that's a 44% jump year over year. But I have to ask you immediately, at $5 trillion, are we looking at actual value or is this just the mother of all bubbles? See, that is the $5 trillion question. But if you look at the fundamentals laid out in the source material, it's really hard to call it a bubble in the traditional sense. A bubble implies speculation on something that might happen. Right, like dot coms without business models. Exactly. But this is payment for infrastructure that is currently being built. And video isn't just a chip company anymore. They are essentially the utility provider for the 21st century. So you're saying they're the electric company? Effectively, yes. Look at the market share. They control over 80% of the AI data center chip market. But the stat that really jumped out to me was the discrete GPU market, 92%. 92% is a monopoly. I don't care how anyone dresses it up. If you want to render anything or train an AI, you are paying the toll. And everyone is paying it. The order book standing at the end of 2025 was half a trillion dollars? Half a trillion. Half a trillion in backlog. That's money already committed for the blackwill generation and the upcoming Rubenchips. This isn't just tech companies buying toys. This is nation states and Fortune 500s completely rebuilding their architecture. They have no choice. If you don't have the compute, you don't have an economy in 2026. So we have this massive consolidation of wealth and power in Silicon Valley. But the report just opposes this with something much grittier. The tariff shock. Right. Because while tech is accelerating, trade is breaking hard. April 1st, 2025. Yeah. The day the trade policy shifted. It was a watershed moment. The Trump administration's trade policy went into full effect and the numbers are just stark. US budget revenues from terrorists quadrupled between June 2024 and November 2025. Quadrupled. That is effectively a massive tax hike. Yeah. Walk me through the mechanics here because usually when we hear the word terrorists, we think about steel or cars or soybeans. But this report highlights you, Vodon, the flavor and fragrance company. Why them? It's a perfect example of the ripple effect. Yodon is a BDB giant. They make the sense for your laundry detergent, your fine perfumes, your sodas. They are deep in the supply chain. So when tariffs hit raw materials like chemicals, essential oils or packaging, companies like Xuvodon have a choice. They can eat the cost and lose profit or they can pass it on to the consumer. And the report says they passed it on aggressively. They implemented significant price increases in 2025 to protect their margins they had to. But here is the mechanism that's really interesting. It's not just about raising prices. It forces innovation. Also. Well, if vanilla becomes 40% more expensive to import, you can't just keep charging more forever. You have to find a way to make a better vanilla or synthetic vanilla or use a more efficient process. So the tariff shock is actually acting as a pressure cooker for R&D. Exactly. It kills off the lazy companies. The giants like Jemotor and survive because they can invest in the tech to circumvent the problem, which ironically brings them right back to buying and video chips to run AI simulations for new molecules. It's a complete circle. Speaking of circles, let's rotate the globe a bit. We talked about US tech dominance and US protectionism. But the report has a section on Europe that I honestly thought was a typo when I first read it. The Polish ascension. Poland. The report states that Poland has surpassed Japan in income per capita at purchasing power parity. It's not a typo. It is probably the most under reported geopolitical shift of the decade. But hold on, Japan is Japan. It's a G7 country. It's synonymous with high tech infrastructure and wealth. How does Poland, which was an emerging market, not that long ago, just jumped the key? You have to look at the metric, purchasing power parity or PPP. Nominal GDP is just dollars, but PPP measures what you can actually buy with your salary. Because things cost different amounts in different places. Right. Living in Tokyo is incredibly expensive. Living in Warsaw, yours Laudie goes much further. So in terms of actual standard of living the size of your house, the food on your table, the average poll has overtaken the average Japanese citizen. That has to be a psychological blow to the old world order. Huge. And it's not just a statistical quirk either. Poland is the 20th largest economy in the world now. While Germany and France are flirting with recession or stagnation, barely growing at maybe half percent or 1 percent, Poland posted 3.4% GDP growth in 2025. And a forecast for 3.7% in 2026. Exactly. It's the engine of Europe right now. We're seeing that in their corporate sector too. As the Orland mentioned here, the energy company. Orland is an absolute beast. They broke the 100 billion PLN capitalization barrier hitting 125.6 billion in February 2026. And PKO BP, the bank, is right behind them at 111.9 billion. These aren't just local players anymore. They are regional powerhouses. But in this deep dive always has a, but there is a massive red flag hanging over Warsaw according to the data. The demographic cliff. It looks more like a demographic collapse, honestly. Births fell below 250,000 annually while deaths exceeded 400,000. That is a net loss of over 150,000 people a year. For a country of Poland size, that is fundamentally unsustainable. It's the old Europe disease hitting the new Europe star. So compare this to the Asian tigers or the post-war boom. Usually you have a growing young workforce driving the economic miracle. Poland is getting richer while physically emptying out. Which brings us back to the technology. If you are Poland and you are losing workers rapidly, you have to automate. You have no choice. You digitize everything. Everything. This explains why Poland is becoming such a massive market for tech integration. They are trying to build a high income economy before they run out of people to actually run it. It's a race against time. It really is. And that tension, that feeling of getting richer, but knowing the foundation is cracking, is something that resonates globally. It's not just a Polish problem. It's the vibe of 2026. Which is the perfect transition to the consumer side of this report. We've established that the macro world is high tech, expensive due to tariffs and demographically anxious. So how are actual human beings spending their money in this environment? They are engaging in recession glam. I have to say I have a love-hate relationship with that term. It sounds a bit like marketing spin for just being broke. It's a little more nuanced than that. Have you heard of the lipstick effect? Yeah, the old economic theory that in a recession women still buy lipstick because it's a small, affordable, morale booster. Exactly. Recession glam is the Gen Z 2026 update to that. It's not just about buying a small product. It's about buying an aesthetic that feels abundant, even if your bank account is totally stretched. And the hero product of this entire movement is Body Mist. The humble body mist. See this is where it gets skeptical. Body mist is what teenagers used to buy for $5 at the drug store to cover up the smell of Jim class. How is this a luxury trend? Because it's not the drug store mist of the 90s anymore, the market has absolutely exploded. It's over $6 billion in the US alone, but it's the positioning that changed. It's high-end mist now. It's positioned as a legitimate fragrance, just at a lower entry point than a $300 bottle of niche perfume. And the 800 pound gorilla here is sold in arrow. Here are the Nvidia of the Body Mist world. Huh. I don't think Jensen Huang would appreciate that comparison, but going. No, look at the dominance. Soldiers Genero is the most popular brand in Sephora, North America. They are number one in fragrances on Amazon US. They hold a 32% share of the entire body spray category on Amazon. That's wild. And for the Lost Tane Group, which owns them, soldiers Genero is now 31.6% of their total sales. That is serious market power. Why them though? Is it just the smell? Is it just the community and the usage? The report highlights a trend called scent stacking. Fat stacking. Gen Z treats fragrance like a wardrobe or a playlist. You don't just have your signature scent anymore. You layer. You spray a base of soldiers narrow carosa 62. Maybe you layer a woodsy niche perfume on top of that and then a floral mist on your hair. It's hyper customized. So it's about identity creation. Exactly. In a digital world where you can't smell people through a screen, fragrance has become this hyper personal tangible luxury for the real world. Just look at the Pinterest data for 2026. Searches for niche perfume collections are up 500%. Wow. And perfume layering combinations are up 125%. People are curating entire libraries of smell. And again, the corporate giants are watching this closely. We mentioned you'd go down struggling with tariffs earlier, but they're fine fragrances division grew 18.3% in 2025. That is massive growth for a mature industry. It really is. And they aren't just guessing what smells good either. They are investing about 8% of revenues annually into innovation. They are using AI. Of course they are. They have a platform called Marissi. It uses AI to translate scent into visual concepts and emotional predictions. So when they design a new recession, glimpsed, they are using algorithms to ensure it hits the exact dopamine trigger the consumers looking for. This is where it gets a little dystopian for me. The report forecasts this shift for 2026 to 2035 toward functional fragrance. This moves beyond just smelling nice to what medicinal smell. Neurocosmetics. That's the industry term. The report notes that 71% of consumers now expect fragrances to offer mood enhancing benefits. We aren't talking about lavender or homotherapy candles here. We are talking about active ingredients like cerebus. It's a gin-sang extract that Javodon is using. The claim is that it actually improves cognitive function and mood, so you spray this on your neck and ostensibly it helps you focus or relax. Let's just zoom out for a second. We have a world where AI is taking over the infrastructure of the economy. That's Nvidia. The pressure on the average worker is immense because of cariffs and massive demographic shifts that's Poland and the trade war. And the consumer response is to buy body mists that literally try to chemically alter their brain state to handle the stress. To feed back loop, we build a high pressure or high speed world and then we invent products to sedate or stimulate ourselves enough to live in it. There's also a technology shift in how these things are actually made. The report mentions blue beauty and biotech. This is the sustainability angle. If everyone on Earth starts scent stacking and spraying gallons of body mist, we run out of flowers. Simple as that. It destroys biodiversity, so the industry is moving to fermentation. Like brewing beer. Very similar principle. We use lab-produced plant molecules, genetically modified yeast or bacteria in a tank. You feed them sugar and they produce specific scent molecules, rose, sandalwood, vanilla. It means you don't have to harvest acres of land. It's lab-grown luxury. It fits the theme perfectly, doesn't it? Even nature is being digitized and industrialized. It is. It's consistent. It's scalable and it's immune to weather and trade tariffs. It's the only way to feed the demand. I want to touch briefly on the visual aesthetics mentioned for the future. We've got vampromantic and glitchy glam driven by Gen Z. Glitchy glam is such a fascinating one. It sounds like a computer error. It's supposed to. It's an aesthetic that embraces the artificiality, asymmetrical concepts, jarring scent combinations, packaging that looks pixelated. It's Gen Z acknowledging that they live in a digital, slightly broken world. And vampromantic. That's the darker side of things. Black cherry, leather, smoke. It's very moody, very bold. If recession glam is about affordable luxury, vampromantic is about affordable darkness. It fits the geopolitical mood, don't you think? It absolutely does. And speaking of geopolitical mood, there is one outlier in the report we haven't touched on yet. Russia. The control group. Right. Because while the rest of the world is dealing with this highly interconnected mess of tariffs and AI chips, Russia is in a state of forced autoreki. They have 35% import tariffs and massive sanctions. So the domestic market there has just gone native. Local producers now control 68% of the market. It's a specific geopolitical economic quirk. A glimpse into what happens when you completely decouple. The market is growing, but it's an island. So we've covered a ton of ground here today. From the five trillion dollar server farms to the streets of Warsaw, all the way to the fermentation tanks making fake rose oil. It's a lot of disparate information to synthesize. But if we try to pull one single thread through all of this, what is it? For me, it's the tension between the artificial and the human. You'll have it on the mountain. Look at Poland. They are facing demographic collapse running out of humans. So they are turning to the artificial automation and tech to fill the gap and keep growing. Look at Nvidia. We're pouring all our global capital into building artificial intelligence. And then look at the consumer. We are feeling the intense stress of this transition, the speed, the cost, the uncertainty, in our response to that stress. Our response is to reach for something that feels doubly human-scent, emotion, mood. But we are using artificial means to get it. We are using AI platforms like Marissi to design the sense. We are using biotech to grow the ingredients and allow. We are using neuro-cosmetics to regulate our own mood. We are becoming compatible with machine. In a way, yes. We are optimizing ourselves just like we optimize the data center. That is profoundly unsettling. It is. But it's also just the reality of 2026. We are navigating a massive structural transition. And usually in transitions, people just want to feel okay. If a $20 body missed with cerebuses makes you feel okay for three hours, that is a highly rational purchase. It's the cheapest therapy available. Exactly. So here is the thought I want to leave you with today. We spent this deep dive talking about how the world is being completely rebuilt by silicon and code. But the most resilient trend isn't a chip. It's the human desire to feel something, anything else. As the workforce shrinks and we rely on AI to fill the gaps, are we also turning to functional fragrances just to cope with the stress of it all? We are building a world of cold efficiency and masking it with a smell of warm vanilla. Insalted caramel. Don't forget the salted caramel. Number forget the salted caramel. Thanks for joining us for this deep dive. Go check your portfolio, maybe check your perfume collection, and really think about what you're actually buying. We'll see you next time.
