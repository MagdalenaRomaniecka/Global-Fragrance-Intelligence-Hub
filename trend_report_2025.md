# Analytical Report: Fragrance Market, Global Economy 2025, and Givaudan Strategy

## 1. Analysis of the Fragrance Market and Consumer Trends

**1.1. The Sol de Janeiro Phenomenon and the Success of the Cheirosa Line**
As FMCG sector analysts, we observe the unprecedented dominance of the Sol de Janeiro brand in the "mass-premium" segment. This brand builds its position not only on volume but on unique cultural positioning, which allows it to maintain higher margins compared to traditional drugstore brands.

Key success factors:
* **Unique scent profiles (gourmand):** Flagship compositions, such as Cheirosa 62 and Cheirosa 71, are based on edible notes that build a strong emotional connection with the consumer, associating with summer and optimism.
* **Versatility and scent-stacking:** The brand's strategy promotes the layered application of fragrances, which increases purchase frequency and attachment to the ecosystem of products in a single line.
* **Longevity and intensity:** Despite being in a mist format, these products offer performance similar to eau de toilette, which increases their utility value in the eyes of the consumer.
* **Digital marketing:** Utilizing the TikTok platform to create the mood and aesthetics of "Brazilian glow" allowed the brand to reach Gen Z and Alpha generations.

| Product Name | Sales Volume (last month) | Retail Price (USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Bodycology Whipped Vanilla (8 fl oz) | 40,367 | $4.62 |
| Victoria’s Secret Love Spell Mist | 28,326 | $16.23 |
| PHLUR Vanilla Skin Body Mist | 26,649 | $38.00 |
| Bath & Body Works Rose Fine Fragrance (8 Fl Oz) | 11,503 | $14.40 |

**Expert analysis:** Although brands like Bodycology dominate in terms of sheer volume due to aggressive pricing ($4.62), PHLUR, with a price of $38.00, is key evidence of the existence of a strong "high-end mist" niche. Sol de Janeiro operates precisely in this area, where price ceases to be a barrier and becomes an indicator of prestige in the mass-market category.

**1.2. The "Recession Glam" Trend and the Evolution of Scent-Stacking**
In the face of global inflationary pressure, the beauty market, valued at $593 billion in 2024, underwent a transformation towards the "Recession Glam" model.
* **Definition of "Recession Glam":** Consumers, forgoing high-value luxury goods (e.g., handbags), compensate by purchasing "little luxuries". Body mists, whose sales grew by 7.1% between 2023 and 2024, perfectly fit into this trend.
* **Scent-stacking strategy:** This is not only an aesthetic trend but also an economic one. It allows for the personalization of cheaper fragrances and enhancing them with "dupes" (substitutes), which is crucial for budget-conscious consumers.

**1.3. Men's Fragrance Preferences: A Machine Learning Analysis**
The application of the DBSCAN algorithm and linear regression allowed for the extraction of two key segments in the men's market.
* **Statistical parameters:**
    * Negative price-to-sales correlation: coefficient -1.81 (price increase reduces demand).
    * Positive impact of availability: coefficient 8.36 (a key success factor in e-commerce).
* **Market segmentation:**
    1. **Cluster 1 (Price-sensitive):** The average price is $43.87. Giorgio Armani eau de toilette dominates here, and the main logistics hub for sales is Dallas.
    2. **Cluster 2 (Premium Segment):** A smaller group, but with high sales dynamics. The average price in this cluster is $28.84. This segment is strongly associated with the Versace brand and a location in Hackensack.

**1.4. Perspectives for the Russian Market up to 2035**
The Russian market is going through a period of forced autarky, which paradoxically stimulates local producers. The market value is projected to grow from $672.5 million in 2024 to $1.095 billion in 2035.
* **State interventionism:** The Russian government allocated $285 million for raw material production and an additional $1 billion for television advertising campaigns for domestic brands.
* **Barriers to entry:** An import tariff of 35% (20% for products from France) is the main growth catalyst for local players, who already control 68% of the market.
* **Market leaders:** Key roles are played by Faberlic and Novaya Zarya.

## 2. Global and Local Economic Situation 2025

**2.1. The Polish Economy in 2025**
The year 2025 brought Poland the status of the region's economic top student. Macroeconomic stabilization directly translates into an increase in the purchasing power of the middle class, which drives the aforementioned "Recession Glam" trend.
* **Milestones:** Poland advanced to the 20th position among the world's largest economies, and the per capita income – according to the IMF – surpassed that of Japan.
* **WSE success:** The Warsaw Stock Exchange became one of the strongest in the world. The companies Orlen and PKO BP were the first to break the 100 billion PLN capitalization barrier.
* **Internal situation:** Inflation has returned to its target, stabilizing consumer spending.
* **Demographics:** The biggest challenge remains the negative natural population growth.

**2.2. Global Trends: USA, AI, and the European Union**
The global economic map is being redefined by US protectionism and the technological race.
* **Trade policy:** Tariffs announced on April 1st shook the markets, forcing FMCG companies to revise their supply chains.
* **Tech Sector:** Nvidia exceeded a capitalization of $5 trillion, becoming the world's most valuable company.
* **Generational changes:** Warren Buffett retired at the age of 95, after 60 years of managing his empire.
* **Competitiveness:** The EU works over 10% less annually than the US, which, combined with American dominance in the field of AI, places Europe in a difficult negotiating position.
