 I was looking at the Euro monitor report this morning, and there is a number that just doesn't square with the current headlines. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I mean, we keep hearing about shrinkflation, the cost of eggs, about this global tightening of belts. That sure. It's on the news every night. Exactly. And yet, the global beauty market, it just clocked in at $593 billion for 2024. Wow. That's nearly a $600 billion contradiction. It's staggering when you put it like that. It is. And usually, when the economy wobbles, luxury is the first thing to go. Absolutely. The big ticket items. Right. You don't buy the Porsche. You don't book the trip to the Maldives. But this year, we're seeing something really, well, really different. We aren't seeing a pullback. We're seeing a pivot. We're calling it recession glam. Recession glam. OK. And it is distinct from what we've seen in previous downturns. I mean, you probably know the lipstick effect, right? Oh, yeah. That's a classic. From the early 2000s recession, I think. That's the one. That famously coined term where women, they bought a Chanel lipstick because they couldn't afford the Chanel bag. Right. It was the affordable entry point to the brand. It was. It was kind of the consolation prize of capitalism. A perfect way to put it. Well, you can basically say the lipstick effect has been deprecated. It's been replaced by the fragrance effect. The fragrance effect. The data is really clear on this. Fragrance alone is projected to drive 23% of all beauty growth through 2029. 23%. That's almost a quarter of all growth in beauty from just one category. It's huge. And it tells a story. We are trading down on assets, houses, cars. But we're trading up on sensory experiences. Which brings us, I think, to the mission for today's deep dive. We aren't just here to review perfumes. We are tracking the money. We're going to look at why a Brazilian-inspired brand called Sol de Janeiro is suddenly outperforming heritage luxury brands. And just for everyone listening, that's pronounced Sol de Janeiro. Thank you, Sol de Janeiro. And then we're going to go to the engine room of the whole industry. Right, to the Swiss giant Givaudan. Which is Givaudan. Yes. We're going there to see how they're using, of all things, artificial intelligence to digitize smell. Because it turns out, in 2026, we aren't just smelling nice. It feels like we're self-medicating with scent. That's the core of it. We absolutely are. That is the part that really hooked me in the research. We are looking at this incredible intersection of economics, neuroscience, machine learning, and just raw nostalgia. All in a little spray bottle. Exactly. So let's start with this concept of recession glam and how it's physically manifesting on the shelves. Because the vehicle for this growth, and this is the surprising part, it isn't actually the high-end $300 Ode to Parfum. No, not at all. And that is the most counterintuitive part of this whole trend. The real growth driver is the body mist. Body mists. I have to be honest. When I hear that term, I am immediately transported back to a middle school locker room in 2004. I think we all are. It smells like synthetic melon and desperation. It feels like a regression in quality, not an upgrade. That is the stigma. Certainly, that's what we all remember. But the economics of what's being called the body mist renaissance are. They're just fascinating. They represent a fundamental shift in how the consumer values luxury. OK, so what are the numbers? The Euro Monitor data shows the category grew by 7.1% from 2023 to 2024. 7.1%. In a single year. That is massive for what you'd consider a mature, almost forgotten category. So why now? I mean, if I have less disposable income, why am I buying a product that historically has less staying power than a traditional perfume? It doesn't seem to make sense on the surface. That's a great question. And as driven by a consumer behavior, the industry has dubbed scent stacking. Scent stacking. Yes. So in the past, the model was really simple. You bought one, say, 100 milliliter bottle of fine fragrance for maybe $150. You sprayed it twice a day, and that bottle lasted you, what, two years? Maybe more. Oh, really? Yeah. From a business perspective, that's terrible for the company's volume turnover. Right, from a business perspective, that is a really, really slow moving skew. You sell one unit to a customer every couple of years. Exactly. So a brand like Sol de Janeiro comes along, and they just crack the code. They effectively start selling a regimen, not a single product. Ah, OK. The subscription model, but for scent. Kind of. You don't just buy the mist. That's just the entry point. You buy the body wash that smells the same, the famous bum bum cream and the hair mist. You layer them. You're stacking them. You're stacking them to create what they call a scent bubble around you. And because the concentration of the actual perfume oils in a mist is lower, usually around 3% to 5%. Compared to what in a perfume, like 15% or 20%. Yeah, 15% is pretty standard for a nôde de parfum. So because the concentration is lower, you feel encouraged to spray more. You have to. You are literally dousing yourself. They call it spraying with abandon, right? I read that phrase. They do. And that behavior, that volume, it drives repurchase rates that traditional luxury brands can only dream of. You're buying a new bottle every couple of months, not every couple of years. It was a brilliant business model. But here's the critical insight you mentioned earlier that I want to circle back to. You said Sol de Janeiro isn't competing with other perfumes. They are competing with anxiety. That's it. That's the whole game. Unpack that for me. OK. Look at their lead scent, their hero product. It's called Kyrosa 62. And Kyrosa is pronounced. She Rosa. It's Brazilian Portuguese. She Rosa. And it means what? It means to smell incredibly delicious. It's actually a really high compliment in Brazil. But here's the key. They market this scent explicitly as a time machine. A time machine to where? To a memory you might not even have. A perfect summer day in Rio. The feeling of sun on your skin. So it's aspirational nostalgia. Exactly. And look at the notes. Pistachios, salted caramel, vanilla. These aren't just gourmand food-like scents. They're specifically chosen because they are designed to trigger the amygdala in your brain to recall a specific type of safety. What kind of safety? The safety of summer, of warmth, of caloric density, sugar, and fat. Our brains are hardwired to read those as signals of comfort and survival. So it's a dopamine hit for $38. It's a cheap, accessible escape. So in a recession environment, or let's even call it a vibe session, where people just feel bad about the economy, regardless of the actual data. Right, the general mood is down. Yeah, this is a cheap escape. It's certainly cheaper than a plane ticket to Brazil. Much cheaper. And unlike a lipstick, which is purely visual, scent is visceral. It's chemical. It changes your physiology before you even consciously process it. You're so right. We're seeing consumers use these mists as mood regulators throughout the day. It's almost like a tool. I'm stressed out at work. I'm going to go spray the happy mist. I need to focus. I'll spray the calm mist. But does it actually work as a perfume? That's the question I keep coming back to. Or does it just vanish in 10 minutes? Because if I'm trading down, I still want value for my money. I don't want to buy scented water. And that is where the glam part of recession glam comes in. The answer is, yes, surprisingly, it does. Oh. The reviews, and more importantly, the chemical analysis, show that despite being labeled as mists, these formulations have surprising longevity. They've engineered them to last. So people are reporting still smelling it hours later. Hours, and sometimes even days later, on clothes or a scarf. Testers report catching whiffs long after they've applied it. So they've basically engineered the volatility of the molecules themselves to stick around, even at those lower concentrations. Precisely. They've cracked the code on performance to price ratio. And that's why they sit in this really interesting space in the market. They're not quite drugstore, but they're not luxury. Exactly. On the shelf, they're competing with mass giants, like Bodycology or Victoria's Secret. But they have the prestige signaling of a Sephora brand. They've carved out this perfect middle ground through what you could call trend-driven marketing. And a good example of that would be Kyrosa 71. A perfect example. That's the one that's described as edible. That's the one. It's just pure decadence. The notes are caramelized vanilla, toasted macadamia nut. It fits perfectly into this huge gourmand trend that we have to talk about next. But it proves that right now, people aren't necessarily looking for fresh or clean or floral. They are looking for comfort. Deep comfort. They want to smell like a bakery because a bakery feels safe. It feels like home. It's the olfactory equivalent of a weighted blanket. That is a perfect, perfect analogy. That's exactly what it is. So if Sol de Janeiro is sort of the poster child for this edible comfort trend, what else is happening in the broader olfactory landscape of 2026? I have the trend report from Doodable here in front of me. And it seems like we're moving in a few almost contradictory directions at once. We are. The landscape is definitely fragmented. But you can see four or five main pillars that are really defining what 2026 smells like. OK, so pillar number one is what we just touched on. Yes. The first one, as we said, is Gourmand 2.0. The 2.0 implies that the 1.0 version needed a serious update. Well, it did. Gourmand 1.0 was that early 2000s pink sugar era. Remember that? Yes. It was just loud synthetic sugar. It kind of screamed at you from across the room. It really did. Gourmand 2.0 is all about balanced indulgence. It's far more sophisticated. So it's not just a straight shot of cotton candy. No, not at all. We are seeing creamy pistachio notes, sure. But in the new formulas, it's paired with dark woods to give it depth. We see whipped cream, but it's cut with something like spicy cardamom or a smoky leather accord to make it more complex. That sounds richer, more adult. It sounds less like a teenager's bedroom and more like a high end dessert at a fancy restaurant. That's the vibe exactly. It's a warm hug rather than a frantic sugar rush. But for the people who find that whole category cloying or too heavy, we have the complete opposite trend emerging right alongside it. And that would be skin sense. Yes. My skin was better. I see this phrase everywhere now. And it sounds to me like the no makeup trend that completely took over the cosmetics world a few years ago. It is exactly that. It's the perfume equivalent. It's designed for the person who works in an open plant office or maybe someone who is just really sensitive to strong fragrances. Who just doesn't want to announce their presence with their scent. Right. And it achieves this by utilizing heavy doses of these specific large format molecular compounds, things like iso-esuper or ambroxam. The stuff that barely smells like anything when you sniff it straight from a bottle. Exactly. On its own, it smells a bit like warm laundry or salty skin or just clean. It's incredibly intimate. It's designed so that someone has to be well within your personal space to even detect it. It's an interesting idea. In a world that feels so crowded and chaotic, there is something very appealing about keeping your personal aura small and controlled. It's almost a form of defensive perfumery. I like that, defensive perfumery. But then, OK, swinging the pendulum completely the other way, we have moody aquatics. Now, I have to push back a little here. Go ahead. When you say aquatic, my mind immediately goes to the 90s. I think of cool water. I think of guys who smell like a synthetic tidal wave just crashed into a department store. Are we really going back there? It's a fair point. But no, we are going back to the water. But it's not the chlorinated swimming pool of the 90s. OK. The 90s aquatics were very hygienic, very sterilized, very blue. The 2026 aquatics are being described as moody. They're earthy. They're more naturalistic. So what does that mean in terms of notes? We're talking algae. Yes, literally algae. Seaweed, driftwood, that iodine smell of a low tide, salt. It's the smell of the ocean on a gray stormy day in November, not a sunny day in July. So it's not vacation. It's nature. It's more raw. Much more raw, which aligns perfectly with the next one on the list, botanical greens. This one feels like a complete rejection of the digital world. Totally. This feels like the desire to touch grass bottled. That's it, literally. And we are seeing these incredibly realistic, almost photorealistic green notes, things like tomato leaf. Tomato leaf is such a distinct smell. It's very sharp and kind of bitter. It is bitter. And that bitterness is the whole point. It feels real. In an era of AI-generated images and deepfakes and everything feeling a bit unreal, people are craving sensory inputs that feel raw and alive. A tomato leaf smells like life. It smells like a garden. It's authentic. I get that. Along with that, you have crushed stems, fresh cut grass, basil, mint, really sharp invigorating scents. And finally, the last big pillar seems to be a cultural one more than a scent-specific one, the death of the binary, genderless and personalized. This is a massive cultural shift that's been building for a while, but now it's really mainstream. The poor home and poor femme labels are starting to look incredibly dated. For men, for women. Yeah. And the modern consumer, especially Gen Z and now Gen Alpha, they choose a scent based on a mood or an ingredient they like, not on a gender label that a marketing department came up with in 1985. So a guy might wear a traditionally feminine rose scent if he wants to feel calm. And a woman might wear a heavy wooden leather scent if she wants to feel grounded and powerful. Exactly. And the brands are leaning into this hard. They're releasing layering kits and special skin primers that change how a scent develops. They're basically handing the chemistry set to the consumer and saying, you're the perfumer now. You figure it out. Which is a fascinating transition. It leaves us perfectly to the people who are actually inventing these molecules in the first place. Right. Because while Sol de Janeiro is the brand we all see on TikTok, they aren't the ones in the lab coats synthesizing these new, moody aquatic molecules. That happens in the engine room. Correct. And the biggest, most powerful engine in the entire world is Givaudan. Givaudan. Yes. Based in Switzerland. And just to give you a sense of their scale, in the first half of 2023 alone, they reported sales of 3.5 billion Swiss francs. 3 and 1 half billion in six months. They are the intel inside of the entire flavor and fragrance world. Your laundry detergent, your soda, your shampoo, and your fine fragrance. Yeah. There's a very high chance they made the key ingredient. And yet, most people have never even heard of them. That's by design. They're a B2B company. But their recent financial reports show this really telling strategic pivot. What's the pivot? Well, while they are this massive global giant, their local and regional clients are growing twice as fast as their global multinational clients. So the real growth isn't coming from the big legacy brands anymore, the Estee Lauders or the L'Oreal's of the world. That's not where the hyper growth is. It is coming from the nimble local players in high growth markets. We're talking Latin America, India, the Middle East. According to their reports, these regions are growing four times faster than mature markets, like North America or Europe. OK, so that tracks perfectly with the sol de genero narrative. The energy, the innovation, the growth, it's all moving south and east. It is. But Givaudan isn't just following the money geographically. They were following it biologically. They were making a huge pivot into what they call functional fragrance. This is where we get into the really sci-fi stuff. You mentioned SarahBoost in the notes. This isn't just perfume anymore, is it? No. This is where Givaudan is intentionally blurring the line between cosmetics and, well, pharmaceuticals, or at least wellness supplements. OK, so what is SarahBoost? SarahBoost is a proprietary American ginseng extract. Now, usually you'd ingest ginseng as a supplement, but they are using it in fragrance to target the gut brain axis through olfactory stimulation. Whoa, hold on. Let's pause on the gut brain axis. We usually think of that in relation to diet, right? Like probiotics and mental health. How does smelling a perfume impact my gut? It's all about the vagus nerve. The vagus nerve is this huge information superhighway that connects the brainstem to the rest of the body, and it influences everything from your heart rate to your digestion. I see. And Givaudan has clinical trials, actual double blind studies, showing that inhaling specific scent molecules, like the ones in SarahBoost, can trigger this neural pathway to lower cortisol levels and actually improve cognitive processing speed. So let's play this out. I'm at my desk. I'm hitting that 3 PM slump. I'm stressed. I spray this functional fragrance. And chemically, it signals your body to focus. It measurably activates the parts of the brain used during cognitive tasks. It's a productivity hack disguised as a cologne. That is wild. We are literally moving from the evolutionary purpose of smelling good to attract a mate to smelling good to optimize my spreadsheet performance. Precisely. It's a whole new paradigm. And they're using AI to sell these incredibly complex concepts. This is where their Merisi technology comes in. This is the color translation tool you mentioned. Yes. And you have to realize this solves the single biggest problem in fragrance e-commerce. You cannot smell through a phone screen. Right. It's the one sense you can't digitize. Until now, sort of, Merisi uses AI to analyze the complete chemical composition of a scent. And it translates that data into a specific color palette that is proven to evoke the same emotional response in the human brain. So if I'm shopping for a perfume on a website, instead of just reading a list of notes like jasmine and sandalwood, which can be kind of abstract, I would see a specific swirl of, say, deep purples and soft, warm pinks that my brain instinctively connects to the feeling that scent is supposed to give me. That's the goal. It bridges the sensory gap between the digital screen and the olfactory nerve. It's all part of their customer foresight platform. They're using big data and AI to predict what you will want to smell before you even know you want to smell it. It's a little bit minority report, isn't it? Pre-crime, but for perfume, we could call it pre-fume. Pre-fume, I like that. Yeah. But it really does raise a serious question about agency, doesn't it? How so? Are you actually choosing the scent because you like it? Or is the algorithm choosing the scent that it knows will optimize your mood based on your browsing history and the time of day? That is slightly terrifying. But it's also a brilliant business strategy. Let's try to ground this a bit. We've talked about high-level corporate strategy and these futuristic Swiss labs. Let's talk about what's actually happening down in the weeds in the used market. Good idea. Because sometimes the best, most honest data isn't in a glossy corporate report. It's on eBay. Yes. And for this, we have a really fascinating academic study from a journal called Judith. It's titled Unraveling of Men's Fragrance Preferences. And this wasn't a survey, right? They didn't just ask a bunch of guys what they like to wear, because we know people. Well, people lie on surveys to sound more sophisticated than they are. Correct. No surveys. This is pure machine learning applied to actual sales data, specifically from eBay. They scraped about 1,000 records of men's cologne sales and then fed it into a clustering algorithm. And the algorithm was called DBS scan. BB scan, yes. Sounds like a villain from a Transformers movie, but it's a very powerful data analysis tool. So what did the evil DBS scan algorithm find in the data? It found that it could divide the entire men's market into two very, very distinct clusters. Cluster one is the masses. This is your price sensitive group. The average price paid for a fragrance in this cluster was around $44. OK, $44. And what was the dominant brand? Giorgio Armani. Has to be Acqua di Gio. The classic. It's been a best seller for, what, 30 years? It almost certainly is. And these were mostly eau de toilette concentrations, the lighter, less expensive versions. OK, so that's cluster one, the masses. What's cluster two? Then you have cluster two. This is the niche premium group. It's a much smaller group of buyers. The average price is significantly higher. And the dominant brand here was Versace. Versace, interesting. And oddly enough, the data was so specific, you could even pinpoint geographic hot spots for this cluster. It called out Hackensack, New Jersey. Hackensack, shout out to Hackensack, the apparent capital of premium men's cologne. It just shows you how granular this kind of data analysis can get. But the really juicy stuff, for me, is in the correlation coefficients they found. OK, let's get into the math. They found a negative correlation coefficient between the price and the number of sales. The number was negative 1.81. OK, so let's unpack that for the non-statisticians listening. A negative correlation of 1.81. That means? It means that as the price goes up, the sales volume goes down. And not just a little bit, but significantly. It confirms that the mass market for men's fragrance is highly price elastic. In other words, men might like the idea of a fancy $300 niche cologne from Creed or Tom Ford. Right. They'll watch the YouTube reviews. They'll read about it. But when it actually comes time to click Buy, they're overwhelmingly buying the $44 bottle of Armani. That's what the data shows. Yeah. But there's a sweet spot, right? An outlier insight in the data. Yes, there was. The algorithm identified a mid-price sweet spot between about $20 and $50. The sales volume in that specific price range was exceptionally high. Which aligns perfectly with what we were saying about recession glam earlier. It's all about trading down to find that perceived value. But here's the paradox that I found fascinating. The study also looked at the text of the eBay listings and found that sellers, and presumably the buyers they're targeting, claim to prioritize aroma first, then greater quality, and price comes last. But the sales data says they actually buy the cheap stuff. Exactly. It's the classic battle between stated preference and revealed preference. We say, oh, I only buy for the highest quality. But then our credit card statement reveals, we bought the one that was on sale. It's human nature. But there was one factor in the study that correlated positively with sales more than anything else. And it wasn't aroma or brand. It was availability. The correlation there was 8.36. An 8.36 positive correlation. That is huge compared to the negative 1.81 for price. It is massive. It dwarfs every other factor they looked at. And it basically says one very simple thing. If it is there, I will buy it. It's as simple as that. Men's fragrance shopping, at least on this platform, appears to be overwhelmingly driven by convenience and lack of friction. If the product is in stock and available right now, it sells. If you have to hunt for it or wait for it to be restocked, the interest just drops off a cliff. So for all the marketing, for all the ads with brooding celebrities on a yacht talking about being a man of distinction and smelling like success, the reality of the transaction is often just, is it on the virtual shelf? Is it under $50? OK, I'll take it. Pretty much. It grounds all of that lofty abstract marketing in the very boring reality of logistics and supply chain friction. Men, it seems, often take the path of least resistance. OK, so this brings us to a really interesting final case study. If Givaudon represents the cutting edge of a globalized high tech scent industry, and the eBay data represents the chaotic reality of the open market, we have to look at the control group. The control group for this whole economic experiment. And that means we have to look at Russia. It's the perfect counterfactual. Because of sanctions and the ongoing war, the Russian market has essentially become a closed loop. It's an isolated ecosystem. They are effectively cut off from the French luxury supply chain that absolutely dominates the rest of the world. And the government there isn't just letting the market sort itself out. They are actively engaged in what economists call import substitution industrialization. They're not just hoping a domestic industry appears. They're trying to build one from the ground up by force. You see these huge 35% tariffs on imported perfumes, specifically targeting what they call unfriendly nations. And there's a specific 20% duty just on French products, right? Exactly. They are making it very clear who is being targeted. So if you are a Russian consumer buying that bottle of Chanel or Dior, just got significantly harder and much, much more expensive if you can even find it. And on the other side of that coin, the government is pouring money into local alternatives. A huge amount of money. The source material points to $285 million. And this is implied to be in local currency funding just for local raw material manufacturing. So they want to make the actual ingredients inside Russia so they don't have to import them from Givaudan or other European chemical giants. That's the long term goal. And in the short term, they've earmarked $1 billion for TV commercials to promote the local brands. That is state-sponsored marketing on a massive scale. So who are the local players who are winning in this new environment? The two big names that have emerged are Faberlich, that's F.A. Berlich, and a much older, more traditional house called Novaya Zarya, which is no V-A-I-Y-A-Z-A-R-Y-A. And their strategy is really clever. It is. They aren't just making cheap knockoffs or simple body sprays. They are specifically creating woody parfum concentrations, higher quality, longer lasting, to go after the mid-premium market. They are trying to directly fill the void that was left when the Western luxury brands pulled out. Correct. And it's working. The report we have says that local brands now hold nearly 68% of the entire market share. 68%. That is a dominant, almost monopolistic position created by government policy. It is. But here's what I really want to know. Are the consumers happy with it? Or is this just a case of forced consumption because there are no other options? That's the key question. And the data suggests that even in a completely closed economy, the fundamental human desire for status remains the primary driver. What do you mean? The report says that Russian consumers still prioritize premium products over mass market ones. They want to feel like they are buying luxury, even if that luxury now comes from a domestic brand like Faberlich instead of a Parisian one. So it proves that the recession glam principle is universal. Even in a wartime economy, even with massive sanctions, people still need that small, affordable lojury to feel good. Absolutely. The drive is the same, even if the brands on the shelf are different. And it's also interesting to note that female fragrances still completely dominate the market share there. It remains a very traditional market in that sense, unlike the big genderless shift we're seeing in the West. So we have traveled an incredible distance in this deep dive. We've gone from the high tech labs of Switzerland with Givaudan to the trending creamy pistachio vibes of Sol de Janeiro in the West, down to the nitty gritty sales data from eBay. And finally, we've landed in the protectionist isolated markets of Russia. It is. It's a lot to take in. It is. But when you zoom out from all the different data points, a really clear, coherent picture starts to emerge. OK, so let's unpack that. Let's synthesize. What does this all mean? When we put it all together, what is the big story of fragrance in 2026? It means that fragrance is no longer just a simple cosmetic accessory. It has. It has graduated. Graduated to what? Well, first, it's a mood regulator. That's the neuroscience from Givaudan and the recession glam aspect from the market data. We are actively, consciously using scent to medicate our anxiety and to transport ourselves to happier, safer feeling places. Also an economic indicator. A very sensitive one, yes. The old lipstick effect is now the fragrance effect. The massive shift to body mists and the whole scent stacking phenomenon tells us exactly how consumers are coping with inflation. They are still spending, but they are hacking the system. They're finding ways to get more value and, more importantly, more dopamine for their dollar. Perfectly said. And third, it's a technological frontier. That's the Givaudan piece, the AI, the machine learning, the attempts to digitize smell. We are moving toward a world where scent is engineered not just to smell good, but to physically and measurably alter your cognitive state. To make you more focused or more relaxed or more creative. Which brings us to the final provocative thought, the thing to chew on after this is over. If Givaudan's AI can predict what I want to smell based on a color palette I glanced at online, and if something like Sarah Boost can chemically improve my focus at work, and if Sol de Janeiro can manufacture a nostalgic memory of a beach I've never actually been to? It raises a very profound question. Are we wearing the perfume, or is the perfume wearing us? That is the part that lingers longer than any of the base notes, isn't it? We think of scent as this very personal, very primal, instinctual choice. I just like how this smells. Right. This is me. But the data suggests our preferences are being predicted, shaped, and perhaps even engineered by algorithms and economic pressures long before we ever pick up that tester's truck. So the next time you pick up that bottle of Ocean Driftwood or creamy pistachio, just take a second and remember you aren't just smelling a scent. You are smelling a data point. And you are participating in a massive global economic shift one spritz at a time. Well, on that note, I think I'm going to go spray on some Ode Anxiety Relief. I think I might join you in that. Thanks for listening to this Deep Dive. And as always, remember to stop and smell the data.
