# Global Consumer Goods Market and Macroeconomic Dynamics: Verification of 2025 Forecasts and Strategic Perspectives for 2026–2035

An analysis of global financial and consumer markets at the turn of 2025 and 2026 provides clear evidence of a profound structural transformation that has redefined the concept of luxury, technological efficiency, and the balance of economic power. The year 2025, described in forecasts as a time of supply shocks and the artificial intelligence revolution, fully realized the assumed scenarios, and in many aspects—such as the capitalization of the technology sector or Poland's economic advancement—significantly exceeded them.

## Architecture of the Global Economy in 2025–2026
The global macroeconomic landscape in 2025 was shaped by two dominant phenomena: the unprecedented concentration of capital in the artificial intelligence sector and the return of aggressive protectionism in United States trade policy. These factors created a unique operating environment for FMCG and luxury goods companies, forcing margin and logistical flexibility.

### The Nvidia Phenomenon and the AI Era
In October 2025, Nvidia's market capitalization crossed the $5 trillion barrier, marking a staggering 44% year-over-year growth. Nvidia controlled over 80% of the market for chips used in AI data centers and held a 92% share in the discrete GPU market. Its order book at the end of 2025 stood at half a trillion dollars, covering both current Blackwell chips and the upcoming Rubin generation.

### Tariff Shock and Protectionism
Donald Trump's trade policy shook markets on April 1, 2025, with the announcement of radical import tariffs. US budget revenues from tariffs quadrupled between June 2024 and November 2025. Companies like Givaudan implemented price increases in 2025 to fully offset the negative effects of tariffs and maintain profit margins.
